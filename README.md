# Air-go-Backend-Project (Java Servlets + JSP + JDBC + Hibernate)

This is a monolithic full-stack flight reservation system built using core Java technologies.  
It simulates the booking and management workflow of an airline system, designed with clean separation between presentation, business, and persistence layers.

> 💡 This project was designed **intuitively without formal knowledge of MVC**, but later recognized as a **well-structured Monolithic MVC architecture**.  
> It reflects real-world thinking in a beginner-friendly format.

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Role-based login: User, Manager, and Admin
- ✅ Polymorphism used to handle role-based services dynamically
- ✅ Clean 3-layered architecture:
  - **Controller** – Servlets
  - **Service Layer** – Interfaces and implementations
  - **DAO Layer** – Responsible for DB communication using JDBC and Hibernate
- ✅ Hibernate ORM integration for booking persistence
- ✅ Booking flow with session tracking
- ✅ Servlet forwarding, JSP responses, and clean form submission handling
- ✅ Docx file generation for booking confirmation (Apache POI)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/GoluCode/Air-go-Backend-Project`

2. Open in **Eclipse** as a Dynamic Web Project

3. Set up **Tomcat** (version 9 preferred)

4. Configure DB credentials in `hibernate.cfg.xml` and/or JDBC connection file

5. Import the provided `.sql` schema file if available (coming soon)

6. Run project → Start from `login.jsp`

## ✅ Upcoming Improvements

- [ ] REST API layer (for front-end independence)
- [ ] JUnit tests for services and DAO (in-progress)
- [ ] Real-time seat availability check
- [ ] One-to-Many + Many-to-One Hibernate relationships
- [ ] Centralized error handling + logging
- [ ] Admin dashboard for analytics and reports

## 🧠 Developer’s Notes

> This project was designed by intuition before learning about formal software architecture patterns.  
> Only later did I discover that my structure closely matches real-world Monolithic MVC.  
> My focus was on:
- Clean separation of responsibilities
- Scalable role management using polymorphism
- Future support for testing and modularization

I believe this foundation can be evolved into a microservice or RESTful API design over time.
